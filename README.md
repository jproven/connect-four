# Connect Four

A modern, responsive implementation of the classic Connect Four game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Classic gameplay:** two players take turns dropping colored discs into a 7x6 grid.
- **Responsive design:** the board and controls adapt to mobile and desktop screens.
- **Modern visuals:** vibrant background, accessible color contrast, and smooth animations.
- **Game logic:** detects wins (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) and prevents moves after game end.

## How to Play

2. Players take turns clicking on the columns to drop their discs.
3. The first player to connect four discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. Click the **Restart** button to play a new game.
